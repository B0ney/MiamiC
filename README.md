# MiamiC
A GTA: Vice City save conversion tool written in Rust.\n
This tool will produce hash-to-hash identical results to Silent's conversion tool (https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=25369).

# How to use:
For Windows users, you can simply drag and drop your save file on the executable.

Alternatively for both Windows and Linux users, you can do this:
miamic "YOUR_SAVE_PATH"
